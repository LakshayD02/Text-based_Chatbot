# Text-based_Chatbot

## Description

This project demonstrates the creation of a basic chatbot that interacts with users through text input and output.  The chatbot's responses are pre-defined, meaning it doesn't use any natural language processing (NLP) or machine learning.  Instead, it relies on simple keyword matching or conditional logic to determine which response to provide based on the user's input.  This is a fundamental example of how to create interactive web applications and handle user input.

## Features

* **Text Input:**  Users can type their messages into a text input field. ⌨️

* **Pre-defined Responses:** The chatbot has a set of pre-defined responses stored within the code (likely in JavaScript). 📝

* **Response Matching:** The chatbot uses logic (e.g., `if/else` statements, `switch` statements, or regular expressions) to match the user's input to keywords or patterns and select the appropriate response. 🔍

* **Text Output:** The chatbot's responses are displayed in a designated area on the webpage.  🗣️

* **Basic Conversation Flow:**  The chatbot can maintain a simple conversation flow by responding to different user inputs in a contextual manner (though limited by the pre-defined responses). 💬

* **HTML Structure:**  The webpage is structured using HTML to include the necessary elements (text input, output area). 🧱


## Ideal For

* **Students:**  Exploring chatbot concepts and building simple interactive applications. 📚

* **Anyone:**  Interested in creating a basic chatbot without complex NLP techniques. 🤖
